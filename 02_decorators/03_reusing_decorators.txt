We can use decorators by importing them from a .py file as shown below. Please reference decorators.py file in this folder for this example

### Python code starts ###
from decorators import my_decorator

@my_decorator
def sample_pring_fun():
    print("Printing from inside function which is decorated")

sample_print_fun()
#Decorator starting
#Printing from inside function which is decorated
#Decorator ending

### Python code ends ###
