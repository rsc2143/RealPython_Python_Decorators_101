Functions can be copied. For example, below is an example function

def add_one(param_number):
    """ This function adds one to the argument passed into the function"""
    return param_number + 1

>>> add_one
<function add_one at 0x7feb3108e7a0>

We can see that the function add_one is stored at the memory location 0x7feb3108e7a0

We can make a copy of the function add_one and store it as another function as follows.

>>> add_one_also =  add_one
>>> add_one_also
<function add_one at 0x7feb3108e7a0>

As can be seen, the add_one_also function is a copy of the function add_one and is stored at the same memory location as add_one function, i.e., at 0x7feb3108e7a0
